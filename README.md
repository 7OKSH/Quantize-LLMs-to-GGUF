### Project Overview

#### Quantizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to GGUF Format

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to quantize large language models (LLMs) using the `llama.cpp` library and convert them to GGUF format. Quantizing models can significantly reduce their size and improve inference speed, making them more efficient for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The project outlines the steps to download a pre-trained model, convert it to GGUF format, apply quantization techniques, and upload the resulting quantized model to Hugging Face for easy access and sharing.

#### Key Features

- **Model Download**: Utilize the Hugging Face Hub to download pre-trained models.
- **Model Conversion**: Convert models to GGUF format using `llama.cpp`.
- **Model Quantization**: Apply quantization techniques to reduce model size and improve performance.
- **Model Upload**: Upload the quantized models back to Hugging Face for easy distribution and use.
